## **ABOUT**
Case design files for the PRKL30 keyboard. 3D_print folder includes files for 3D printable cases and Lasercut folder includes files for sandwich style case. Once I finish design there will be 3D-printable case files for choc swiches and ble-feather controller.



## **3D_print folder includes:**

PRKL30_MX_promicro

## **Lasercut folder includes:**

prkl30 2layer
* This case design is used for open 2layer case that could be combined with 3d printed midlayer.

prkl30 sandwich
* This case design is used for promicro builds.

prkl30 ble sandwich
